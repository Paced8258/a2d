# Setup Summary - LangFuse Integration

## What Was Done

### âœ… Completed Changes

1. **Added LangFuse Package**
   - Installed `langfuse==3.6.2`
   - Added to `requirements.txt`

2. **Updated Settings** (`settings.py`)
   - Added LangFuse credentials (optional):
     - `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY`
     - `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY`
     - `LANGFUSE_HOST`
   - Added `DATABASE_URL` setting (now configurable!)
   - All settings have sensible defaults

3. **Made Database Configurable** (`db.py`)
   - Now uses `settings.database_url` instead of hardcoded SQLite path
   - Easy to switch to PostgreSQL when ready to deploy
   - Just change the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable

4. **Prepared LangFuse Infrastructure** (`main.py`)
   - Added optional LangFuse client initialization
   - Helper function `_get_langfuse_client()` ready to use
   - App works perfectly with or without LangFuse configured

5. **Created Documentation**
   - `README.md`: Updated with LangFuse info and environment variables
   - `LANGFUSE_SETUP.md`: Complete LangFuse integration guide
   - `env.example`: Template for environment variables

## Current State

**Your app is fully functional and ready to use!**

- âœ… Works without any LangFuse configuration
- âœ… Ready to add LangFuse when you want observability
- âœ… Database is now easily switchable (SQLite â†’ PostgreSQL)
- âœ… All settings managed through environment variables

## Files Changed

```
modified:   requirements.txt       (added langfuse)
modified:   settings.py            (added LangFuse + database settings)
modified:   db.py                  (uses configurable database URL)
modified:   main.py                (LangFuse client initialization)
modified:   README.md              (documentation updates)
created:    LANGFUSE_SETUP.md      (comprehensive LangFuse guide)
created:    env.example            (environment variable template)
created:    SETUP_SUMMARY.md       (this file)
```

## How to Use

### Option 1: Continue Without LangFuse (Recommended for Now)

Just keep using your app as-is. Everything works!

```bash
python main.py
```

### Option 2: Add LangFuse Later

When you're ready for LLM observability:

1. Sign up at https://cloud.langfuse.com (free)
2. Get API keys
3. Add to `.env` file:
   ```bash
   LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=sk-lf-...
   LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk-lf-...
   ```
4. Add `@observe` decorators to your endpoints (see LANGFUSE_SETUP.md)
5. Restart server
6. View traces in LangFuse dashboard!

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Optional)
- [ ] Copy `env.example` to `.env` and customize
- [ ] Test the /recommendations endpoint
- [ ] Explore the database with SQLite browser

### When Ready to Deploy
- [ ] Switch `DATABASE_URL` to PostgreSQL
- [ ] Set up LangFuse for production monitoring
- [ ] Deploy to Railway/Render/Fly.io

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Fix FastAPI deprecation warning (migrate to lifespan handlers)
- [ ] Add full LangFuse tracing with `@observe` decorators
- [ ] Add rate limiting
- [ ] Add user authentication
- [ ] Add caching layer (Redis)

## Testing Your App

```bash
# 1. Start the server
python main.py

# 2. Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# 3. Create a session
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/onboard \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"role":"Product Manager","industry":"SaaS","pains":"Too many meetings"}'

# 4. Chat (replace thread_id with the one from step 3)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"thread_id":1,"message":"What should I stop doing?"}'

# 5. Get recommendations
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/recommendations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"thread_id":1}'
```

## Environment Variables Reference

Create a `.env` file with these variables:

```bash
# Required
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...your-key...

# Optional (with defaults)
MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///anti_todo.db

# Optional (LangFuse - leave blank to disable)
LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=sk-lf-...
LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk-lf-...
LANGFUSE_HOST=https://cloud.langfuse.com
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Deployment Ready**: Can switch to PostgreSQL with one line
2. **Observability Ready**: LangFuse infrastructure in place
3. **Clean Configuration**: All settings via environment variables
4. **Well Documented**: Comprehensive guides for setup and deployment
5. **Flexible**: Works with or without optional features
